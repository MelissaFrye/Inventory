#  A little showcase for my object-oriented programming and design skills, developed using IntelliJ IDEA, GUI using JavaFX with FXML. 
Using oo-design concepts (such as inheritance abstraction and encapsulation) and exception-handling, inventory_tracker organizes and displays accurate invetory data. Products are made up of various Parts. Some Parts are outsourced and some made in-house. Products and Parts are can be added, modified, or deleted.

Products class is an interface.
Parts class is an interface.

Contains JavaDocs comments plus standard best-practices comments

A FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
 * would connect the inventory value of a part to a Product's associated parts list to let the end user know how many
 * Products could be made from the Part quantities on-hand and could also be used to suggest Product's retail price based on total part cost.
